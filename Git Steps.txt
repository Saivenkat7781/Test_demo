Create 3 txt files, lets say info1.txt, info2.txt, info3.txt

Branching steps

1.Create a branch
2.Switch to new branch from master branch
3.Create and add info.txt to first_branch
4.Commit that file to first_branch
5.Merge the documents into master branch

Before merging we need to checkout to master and commit

In the master branch we see only "demo, info1 and info2".

-git merge BRANCH_NAME (To merge the branch)
